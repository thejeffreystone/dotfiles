# Upgrading from 2.x.x to 3.x.x

## Changing the template directory

There is just a little change between 2 and 3, it is the location of the template
directory. It is no longer the root in the project, but a sub-directory namedâ€¦
`template`. Why this change ? Because even if the update script can ignore the
documentation, the tests and itself, `git clone` and `git init` do not. It means
each time you create a new repository, and each time you clone a repository, while
using Git Template 2.x.x, `git` will copy files that are part of the project but
that are not part of the template itself.

To change that, upgrade to 3.x.x, and adjust your `init.templatedir` variable:

    git config --global init.templatedir '~/.git_template/template'

And remote the old hooks directory tree (it should contain no file at all)

    rm -rf ~/.git_template/hooks

After that you will be able to safely run the update script from any project you
have.

## Cleaning up repositories

If you do not like the mess I have created in your repositories, please:

- accept my sincerest apologies
- run the cleanup script I wrote: `/path/to/.git_template/cleanup-2-x-x-mess.sh`
from the root of each repository you want to clean.
